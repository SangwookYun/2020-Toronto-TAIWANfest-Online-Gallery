                Food banks across the United States have been 
                seeing an unprecedented uptick in usage since 
                the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 
                dozens of Chicago natives and current residents 
                have joined together to provide local aid. 
                Since June 25, Prints for Hunger has raised 
                $20,000 for the Greater Chicago Food Depository 
                through its online fundraiser selling 84 
                photographers' significant works from the past 
                few decades.
